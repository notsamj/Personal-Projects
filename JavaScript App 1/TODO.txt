1. Fix the position of the delete button FIXED is not good
2. Revert from the practice of downloading the entire list after adding something
3. Allow local sorting so get the ids/indexes figured out
4. Make client interactions synchronous (so not downloading 2 lists at once and potentially)
5. Multi-client features.
6. Make the edit button when clicked add a delete button to the front of each item so it can be easily deleted
7. Add a separate tab for common items that can be easy added to the list (similar to edit delete button but always there)
N-1. Refactor code things like id/index -> index or -> id but not both
N. Comment
