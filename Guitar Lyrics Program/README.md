## Run with alternative text data / songs

### Alternative Song/Audio
1. Convert any audio file you want to use to .mp3
2. Name the audio file (name).mp3
3. Put the audio file (name).mp3 in a folder named (name) so the file structure looks like (name)/(name).mp3
4. Put the audio folder (name) in either songs/public or songs/local. If using song/local, create the directory "local" then go into data.js and change "sound_data"/"using_local" to `true`
5. Select the audio by clicking browse -> navigate to the proper folder -> select the .mp3 file -> select open

### Alternative text data
The format of the text data is chronological by line. \
As stated in the tutorial, text data is submitted through the provided text area. \
I recommend storing it in a .txt file in the same folder as the .mp3 file.

## My vision for the program
As with all the software I create, it is created because I intend to use it. \
I've been trying to learn guitar and have found it difficult to synchronize the instructions with songs when attempting to play along. \
I made this program to resemble karaoke videos that you can create yourself either for karaoke or for trying to play something on guitar. \
Updates may come in the future if I feel they are needed for my usage.
## Additional Information
Program was tested on Windows, not tested on Mac/Linux.
