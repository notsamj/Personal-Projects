; Program Start Up

; Comments about the program:
;	About my proficiency in lisp:
;		I do not claim to be very proficient in lisp. I took one course that used
;		Lisp recently and with it being a tricky language, I decided it would be good
;		to make a small program to showcase my knowledge. I'm aware that my use
;		of 'cond' is probably improper, I neglected to learn how to use other if/else
;		branching in this language.

; Represent the three rings large "l", medium "m", small "s"

; What this means is 0->"l"/large 1->"m" 2->"s"
(setq indexToRingIdentifier ("l" "m" "s"))
; Starting Values. All start on Tower 1
(setq indexToLocationStarting (1 1 1))
; State representation of goal (all rings on 3)
(setq goalState (3 3 3))

; Initialized visited states global variable
(setq visited ())

; TODO: removeVisitedStates
; TODO: generateNewStates

; Function Name: stateEqualsR
; Function Parameters:
;	state1/state2:
;		One of two states to compare
;	currentIndex:
;		The current index in the states to compare
; Function Description:
; 	Compares the equality of two given states from the current position to the end.
; Noteworthy Assumptions:
;	It is assumed both states are lists of integers.
; 	It is assumed that both states are of equal length.
;	It is assumed that both states have an element at the given position.
; Function Return:
;	't' if the states are equal, 'nil' if not (if at the end)
;   if not at the end, a recursive call to stateEqualsR

; Function Name: stateEquals
; Function Parameters:
; 	state1/state2:
;		One of two states to compare
; Function Description:
;	Compares the equality of two given states.
; Noteworthy Assumptions:
;	It is assumed both states are lists of integers.
; 	It is assumed that both states are of equal length.
;	It is assumed that both states have at least 1 element*.
;	* For the program they should have 3 elements but for the scope of this function
;	irrespective of the specifications of the program they only need 1 element.
; Function Return:
;	't' if the states are equal, 'nil' otherwise.

; Function Name: towerOfHanoiDFS
; Function Parameters:
;	currentState:
;		A parameter for the function, a list in the form ([1-3] [1-3] [1-3]) where
;		each element @ index i represents a number between 1 & 3 (inclusive) which
;		specifies a tower at which the ring (@ index i in indexToRingIdentifier) is 
;		located
;   pathToCurrentLocation:
;		A list of states from the starting state to the current state
; Function Description:
; 	This function is the main function for the running the program.
;	This function traverses states using a depth-first manner to reach the goal. 
; Function Return:
; 	A sequence of states from the start to the goal state. The sequence is generated
;	by legal moves.
