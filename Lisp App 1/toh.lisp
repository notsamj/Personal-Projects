; Comments about the program:
;	About my proficiency in lisp:
;		I do not claim to be very proficient in lisp. I took one course that used
;		Lisp recently and with it being a tricky language, I decided it would be good
;		to make a small program to showcase my knowledge. I'm aware that my use
;		of 'cond' is probably improper, I neglected to learn how to use other if/else
;		branching in this language.
;	General comments about the program:
;		I put a recognition of assumptions section for some functions where I though it was necessary.
;		I neglected assumptions for other functions.
;		I probably overused 'progn'
;		I probably over/mis-used 'cond'
;		I never used the 'break' construct. I don't know if it exists in LISP.

; Function Description:

; Function Return:
;	An integer representing a state's value
