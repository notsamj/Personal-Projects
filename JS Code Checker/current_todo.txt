Not working for multi parameter methods / functions?
Pseudo interfaces/classes
Check for all TODOs(
console.log("myfile.js (L44)", arg1, arg2, etc.) replace with console.log("myfile.js (L44)", arg1, arg2, etc.) if its moved to line 45 for example
	Also console.log("$FL" -> console.log("myfile.js (L44)"


Notes:
	Not going to support having multiple methods with the same name in one file. This currently breaks the program.

		This means if you have class A
			test(){}
		in the same file as class B
			test(){}

		you will get 2 comments made on class A or B test instead of 1 on each
