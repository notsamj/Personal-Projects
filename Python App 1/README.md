## Application Purpose
Python App 1 provides a simple config class supporting individual values and lists of data types:
- String
- Boolean
- int

## How to run
Run command `python3 main.py`

### Data
The config can be configured in `data.txt`\
The present data in the file is from an old private personal project.


## Application History
It does not include comments because I didn't originally intend it to be posted publicly. I wrote it as part of a personal project
a few years ago and only refactored it and added `main.py` to illustrate its use in 2023.
